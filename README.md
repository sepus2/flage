# flage
Flage php - Powerful, flexible and efficient templating engine for PHP
Compiled performance is very close to the same code written in php.

TODO: 
Add good documentation
Add good examples
Refactor tags
Add callbacks for tags
Add forelse (simpliest implementation is incrementing a variable right after for loop started and use it to determine if there was at least one iteration : requires callbacks)
Add loopelse
Add whileelse
Add for $k,$v in [statement]
